        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>This project is focused on <em>an application with Unity3D on VR headsets</em>. Our goal is to <em>develop a 
            solution of test anxiety alleviation with a game where users can control a vurtual avatar to write with 
            motion capture gloves.</em>.</p>
        <p>Our project will be developed using <strong>Unity3D</strong> and <strong>VR headsets</strong>. The project 
            will be developed by a team of four members.</p>

        <h2>Project Progress</h2>
        <p><strong>1. Aug 22nd 2024</strong> We have learned the basics of Unity3D environment and a basic program has been written.</p>

        <p><strong>2. Aug 28th 2024</strong> We have achieved the connection between PICO and the computer, experienced the virtual reality 
            scene, and familiarized ourselves with the relevant operation process.</p>
        <video src="videos/experiencing.mp4" controls width="640" height="360"></video>
        <p><strong>3. Sept 1st 2024</strong> We have implemented PICO and glove to computer connection, which can capture finger movements 
            in simulated classroom environment, but it seems impossible to write with a pen. </p>

        <p><strong>4. Sept 5th 2024</strong> Our device was able to successfully capture gestures and complete writing on paper in a 
            simulated classroom environment, but the writing was not stable and precise enough.</p>
        <p><strong>5. Sept 8th 2024</strong> We have achieved relatively stable writing and invited other students to experience PICO 
            and simulate classroom environments, and exchange their experiences and insights.</p>

        <h2>Project Results</h2>
        <p>After multiple rounds of debugging and testing, we successfully connected PICO, sensing gloves, and a computer, and experienced the simulated exam system in Unity. 
            Through calibration in Unity in the early stage and subsequent adjustments to sitting posture and glove sensor orientation, normal finger movement in the scene was achieved. 
            By holding the "pen" in the scene, basic answers can be given on the exam paper in the scene.

        <img src="images/p3.jpg" type="jpg" width="500" height="300">
        <p> In order to simulate a more realistic classroom scene, student Zhang Xinzhe in the group added a patrol teacher outside the classroom corridor, 
            who would periodically walk back and forth outside the classroom corridor.

        <p>
            Finally, our group invited a student outside of the course to experience our equipment and simulated exam system. 
            He shared his experience and gave our group some expectations and suggestions.
