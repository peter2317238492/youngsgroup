        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>This project is focused on <em>an application with Unity3D on VR headsets</em>. Our goal is to <em>develop a 
            solution of test anxiety alleviation with a game where users can control a vurtual avatar to write with 
            motion capture gloves.</em>.</p>
        <p>Our project will be developed using <strong>Unity3D</strong> and <strong>VR headsets</strong>. The project 
            will be developed by a team of four members.</p>

        <p><strong>1. Aug 22nd 2024</strong> We have learned the basics of Unity3D environment and a basic program has been written.</p>
        <img src="images/IMG_2162.JPG" alt="Unity3D Environment">
        <p><strong>2. Aug 28th 2024</strong> We have achieved the connection between PICO and the computer, experienced the virtual reality 
            scene, and familiarized ourselves with the relevant operation process.</p>
        <video src="videos/experiencing.mp4" controls class="responsive-video"></video>
        <p><strong>3. Sept 1st 2024</strong> We have implemented PICO and glove to computer connection, which can capture finger movements 
            in simulated classroom environment, but it seems impossible to write with a pen. </p>

        <p><strong>4. Sept 5th 2024</strong> Our device was able to successfully capture gestures and complete writing on paper in a 
            simulated classroom environment, but the writing was not stable and precise enough.</p>

        <p><strong>5. Sept 8th 2024</strong> We have achieved relatively stable writing and invited other students to experience PICO 
            and simulate classroom environments, and exchange their experiences and insights.</p>

        <h2>Project Results</h2>
        <p>We have made a  test stress relief system based on Unity3D in which user can use tracking gloves to simulate writing in VR test classroom. 
            The system can help users to alleviate test anxiety and improve their test performance.
            We invited 10 students to experience the system and 8 of them reported that they felt less anxious during the test after using the system.
            The system has been well received by the students and we are planning to further improve the system and conduct more tests.
